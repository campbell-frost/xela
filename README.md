# xela

*note: xela isn't done yet*

Notes, encrypted and versioned in your Git repository.

## Usage

Download the executable for your platform and run it.

There's also a separate CLI app that can extract your notes into plaintext so you always have the ability to migrate away.

## Implementation

Go and Elm. The codebase is small enough that you can read it. It has very few (transitive!) dependencies.
